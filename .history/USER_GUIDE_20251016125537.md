# Excel Comparison Tool - User Guide

## Overview
This tool compares two Excel sheets and identifies differences based on the **Description** column.

## Column Mapping
The tool automatically recognizes and maps the following columns:

| Your Column Name | Mapped As     | Purpose                          |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Seq.             | Seq.          | Sequence number                  |
| Description      | Description   | **Primary Key for Comparison**   |
| Quantity (Qty)   | Quantity      | Compared for changes             |
| Unit Price       | Unit Price    | Compared for changes             |
| Amount           | Amount        | Compared for changes             |
| Other columns    | (Ignored)     | Treated as comments, not compared|

## How Comparison Works

### üîç Comparison Logic
1. **Description is the Key**: Each row is identified by its Description field
2. **Only Specified Columns Compared**: Seq., Description, Quantity, Unit Price, and Amount
3. **Other Columns Ignored**: Any additional columns (like Terms, comments, etc.) are not compared

### üìä Three Categories

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Canceled Items (üóëÔ∏è Red Button)
- **What it shows**: Items that exist in the OLD file but are MISSING in the NEW file
- **Use case**: Items that were deleted/removed
- **Example**: 
  - Old file has: "WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18"
  - New file doesn't have this description
  - Result: Shows in "Canceled Items"

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Edited Items (‚úèÔ∏è Orange Button)
- **What it shows**: Items where ANY of the compared columns changed
- **Displays**: Both OLD and NEW versions side by side
- **Visual indicators**:
  - Yellow row (üìã Old) = Original values
  - Blue row (‚ú® New) = Updated values
  - Red highlighted cells with ‚úé icon = Changed values
- **Example**:
  ```
  Description: WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18
  Old: Quantity = 8, Unit Price = 14.80, Amount = 118.40
  New: Quantity = 10, Unit Price = 14.80, Amount = 148.00
  Changed: Quantity and Amount (highlighted in red)
  ```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ No Change (‚úÖ Green Button)
- **What it shows**: Items that are IDENTICAL in both files
- **Criteria**: All compared columns (Seq., Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Amount) are the same

## Step-by-Step Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files
Ensure both Excel files have these columns:
- Seq.
- Description
- Quantity (or Qty)
- Unit Price
- Amount

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Click **"Choose File"** under "Old Excel File"
2. Select your original Excel file (.xlsx, .xls, or .csv)
3. Click **"Choose File"** under "New Excel File"
4. Select your updated Excel file

### Step 3: Compare
1. Click the **"Compare Files"** button
2. Wait for processing (usually takes a few seconds)
3. View the summary card showing totals:
   - Deleted items count
   - Modified items count
   - Unchanged items count

### Step 4: Review Results
Click on any of the three filter buttons to see detailed results:

**Canceled Items** - View items removed from new file
- Shows complete row from old file
- Helps identify what was deleted

**Edited Items** - View modified items
- Shows OLD version (yellow background)
- Shows NEW version (blue background)
- Changed cells highlighted in red with ‚úé icon
- Compare values side by side

**No Change** - View unchanged items
- Confirms items that remain the same
- Useful for validation

## Important Notes

### ‚úÖ What IS Compared
- Seq. (Sequence number)
- Description (Primary key)
- Quantity
- Unit Price
- Amount

### ‚ùå What is NOT Compared

### üéØ Key Features
- **Description-based matching**: Items matched by Description, not position
- **Case-sensitive**: "WASHER" ‚â† "washer"
- **Whitespace sensitive**: Trailing spaces matter
- **Visual highlights**: Changed values clearly marked
- **Mobile-friendly**: Works on all devices
- **Real-time**: Instant comparison results

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Price Update
```
Old: WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18 | 8 PCS | 14.80 | 118.40
New: WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18 | 8 PCS | 15.50 | 124.00
Result: Shows in "Edited Items" - Unit Price and Amount highlighted
```

### Scenario 2: Quantity Change
```
Old: WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18 | 8 PCS | 14.80 | 118.40
New: WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18 | 10 PCS | 14.80 | 148.00
Result: Shows in "Edited Items" - Quantity and Amount highlighted
```

### Scenario 3: Item Removed
```
Old: WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18 | 8 PCS | 14.80 | 118.40
New: (Item not present)
Result: Shows in "Canceled Items"
```

### Scenario 4: No Changes
```
Old: WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18 | 8 PCS | 14.80 | 118.40
New: WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18 | 8 PCS | 14.80 | 118.40

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No results showing
- **Check**: Both files uploaded?
- **Check**: Files have "Description" column?
- **Check**: Files are valid Excel format?

### Problem: Items not matching correctly
- **Check**: Description spelling is identical in both files
- **Check**: No extra spaces in Description field
- **Check**: Case matches (uppercase/lowercase)

### Problem: Too many items in "Edited"
- **Check**: Are there rounding differences in numbers?
- **Check**: Are there formatting differences (e.g., "8" vs "8.0")?

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Clean your data**: Remove extra spaces from Description column
2. **Consistent formatting**: Use same number format in both files
3. **Unique descriptions**: Each item should have a unique description
4. **Column headers**: Ensure column names match (Seq., Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Amount)
5. **File format**: Use .xlsx format for best compatibility

## Technical Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify Excel file structure
3. Try with a smaller sample file first
4. Ensure files are not corrupted
