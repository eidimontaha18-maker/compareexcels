# ‚úÖ ACCURATE COMPARISON LOGIC - FINAL SPECIFICATION

## üéØ Core Logic (Exactly as You Requested)

### Step 1: Match Rows Using Composite Key
**Matching Criteria:** BOTH Seq. AND Description must be identical

```
Row is considered "THE SAME ITEM" if:
  ‚úì Seq. (from old file) == Seq. (from new file)
  AND
  ‚úì Description (from old file) == Description (from new file)
```

### Step 2: Check for Changes (Only After Matching)
**Once matched, compare ONLY these three columns:**
- Quantity
- Unit Price
- Amount

## üìä Three Categories Explained

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CANCELED ITEMS üóëÔ∏è
**Definition:** Items where the Seq. + Description combination exists in OLD file but NOT in NEW file

**Logic:**
```
IF (Seq. + Description from old file) NOT FOUND in new file
THEN ‚Üí CANCELED ITEM
```

**Example:**
```
Old File: Seq="0001" + Desc="WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18"
New File: This combination doesn't exist
Result: CANCELED (item deleted)
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ EDITED ITEMS ‚úèÔ∏è
**Definition:** Items where Seq. + Description match, BUT at least one of (Quantity, Unit Price, Amount) changed

**Logic:**
```
IF (Seq. + Description from old file) FOUND in new file
AND (Quantity changed OR Unit Price changed OR Amount changed)
THEN ‚Üí EDITED ITEM
```

**Example 1: Quantity Changed**
```
Old File: Seq="0001" + Desc="WASHER TANK..." + Qty=8 + Price=14.80 + Amount=118.40
New File: Seq="0001" + Desc="WASHER TANK..." + Qty=10 + Price=14.80 + Amount=148.00
Result: EDITED (Quantity and Amount changed)
```

**Example 2: Price Changed**
```
Old File: Seq="0001" + Desc="WASHER TANK..." + Qty=8 + Price=14.80 + Amount=118.40
New File: Seq="0001" + Desc="WASHER TANK..." + Qty=8 + Price=15.00 + Amount=120.00
Result: EDITED (Unit Price and Amount changed)
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ NO CHANGE ‚úÖ
**Definition:** Items where Seq., Description, Quantity, Unit Price, AND Amount are ALL identical

**Logic:**
```
IF (Seq. + Description from old file) FOUND in new file
AND Quantity is SAME
AND Unit Price is SAME
AND Amount is SAME
THEN ‚Üí NO CHANGE
```

**Example:**
```
Old File: Seq="0001" + Desc="WASHER TANK..." + Qty=8 + Price=14.80 + Amount=118.40
New File: Seq="0001" + Desc="WASHER TANK..." + Qty=8 + Price=14.80 + Amount=118.40
Result: NO CHANGE (everything identical)
```

## üîç Important Rules

### ‚úÖ What Matters for Matching
1. **Seq.** - Must be exactly the same
2. **Description** - Must be exactly the same
3. **Both together** - Form a composite key

### ‚úÖ What Gets Checked for Changes
1. **Quantity** - Compared after matching
2. **Unit Price** - Compared after matching
3. **Amount** - Compared after matching

### ‚ùå What's Ignored
- Terms column
- Comments column
- Any other columns
- Seq. and Description are NOT checked for changes (they're used for matching only)

## üé® Visual Display

### Canceled Items View
- Shows rows from old file
- Red theme
- Lists items that were deleted

### Edited Items View
- Shows PAIRS of rows (OLD then NEW)
- Yellow row = üìã Old values
- Blue row = ‚ú® New values
- Red cells with ‚úé = Changed values (only Qty, Price, or Amount)

### No Change View
- Shows rows that are identical
- Green theme
- Lists items that remained the same

## üìù Real-World Example

### Your Excel Format:
```
| Seq. | Description                    | Quantity | Unit Price | Amount  |
|------|--------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|
| 0001 | WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18    | 8 PCS    | 14.80      | 118.40  |
```

### Test Scenarios:

#### Scenario A: Item Deleted
```
Old: Seq=0001, Desc=WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18, Qty=8, Price=14.80, Amount=118.40
New: (This Seq + Desc combination doesn't exist)
‚Üí CANCELED ITEMS (1 item)
```

#### Scenario B: Quantity Changed
```
Old: Seq=0001, Desc=WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18, Qty=8, Price=14.80, Amount=118.40
New: Seq=0001, Desc=WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18, Qty=10, Price=14.80, Amount=148.00
‚Üí EDITED ITEMS (1 item, 2 rows shown)
   Highlighted: Quantity (8‚Üí10) and Amount (118.40‚Üí148.00)
```

#### Scenario C: No Changes
```
Old: Seq=0001, Desc=WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18, Qty=8, Price=14.80, Amount=118.40
New: Seq=0001, Desc=WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18, Qty=8, Price=14.80, Amount=118.40
‚Üí NO CHANGE (1 item)
```

#### Scenario D: Description Changed (Different Item!)
```
Old: Seq=0001, Desc=WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 18, Qty=8, Price=14.80, Amount=118.40
New: Seq=0001, Desc=WASHER TANK W/MOTOR CHR 20, Qty=8, Price=14.80, Amount=118.40
‚Üí CANCELED ITEMS (1 item) - because Seq + Desc combo doesn't match
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

1. **Case Sensitive:** "WASHER" ‚â† "washer"
2. **Space Sensitive:** "CHR 18" ‚â† "CHR  18" (extra space)
3. **Both Required:** If Seq. matches but Description doesn't ‚Üí NOT a match ‚Üí CANCELED
4. **Composite Key:** Seq="0001" + Desc="A" is different from Seq="0001" + Desc="B"
5. **Order Doesn't Matter:** Rows can be in any order in the Excel files
