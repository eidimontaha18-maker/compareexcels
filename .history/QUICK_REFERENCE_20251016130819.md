## 📋 Accurate Comparison Logic

### 🔑 Matching Keys (Must Both Match):
- **Seq.** ⭐ (Sequence number)
- **Description** ⭐ (Item description)
- **Both must be identical** for rows to be considered the "same item"

### ✅ Values Checked for Changes:
- **Quantity** (or Qty) - Checked AFTER matching
- **Unit Price** - Checked AFTER matching
- **Amount** - Checked AFTER matching

### ❌ These columns are IGNORED:
- Terms
- Comments
- Notes
- Any other columns
