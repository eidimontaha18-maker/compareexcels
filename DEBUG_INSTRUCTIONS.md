# üîç DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS

## How to Debug Why Changes Aren't Being Detected

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173/
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Click on the **Console** tab

### Step 2: Upload Your Files
1. Upload your old Excel file
2. Upload your new Excel file
3. Click "Compare Files"

### Step 3: Check Console Output
After clicking "Compare Files", you'll see detailed debug information:

#### What to Look For:

**1. Column Detection:**
```
Old file columns: ["Seq.", "Description", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Amount", ...]
Old file first row: { Seq.: "0001", Description: "WASHER TANK...", Quantity: "8 PCS", ... }

New file columns: ["Seq.", "Description", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Amount", ...]
New file first row: { Seq.: "0001", Description: "WASHER TANK...", Quantity: "10 PCS", ... }
```

**Check:**
- ‚úì Are the column names normalized correctly?
- ‚úì Do you see "Seq.", "Description", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Amount"?
- ‚úì Are the values being read correctly?

**2. Change Detection:**
```
Change detected in Quantity: {
  old: "8 PCS",
  new: "10 PCS",
  oldNormalized: "8 PCS",
  newNormalized: "10 PCS"
}
```

**Check:**
- ‚úì Are changes being detected?
- ‚úì Do the normalized values look correct?
- ‚úì Are numbers being compared properly?

**3. Comparison Summary:**
```
Comparison Results: {
  oldDataCount: 10,
  newDataCount: 10,
  canceled: 0,
  edited: 2,
  noChange: 8
}
```

**Check:**
- ‚úì Does the count make sense?
- ‚úì Are there items in each category?

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Column Names Not Matching
**Symptoms:** Console shows wrong column names like "Seq" instead of "Seq."

**Solution:** The column normalization needs adjustment. Please share the exact column names from your Excel file.

### Issue 2: Values Not Being Compared
**Symptoms:** No "Change detected" messages in console, but you know there are changes

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Whitespace differences:** "8 PCS" vs "8  PCS" (extra space)
2. **Number format:** "14.8" vs "14.80"
3. **Data type:** Number 8 vs String "8"

**What to check:** Look at the first row output and see exactly how values appear

### Issue 3: All Items Show as "Canceled"
**Symptoms:** Everything appears in Canceled Items

**Possible Causes:**
1. Seq. or Description columns not found
2. Column name mismatch between files
3. Values in Seq./Description are different format

**What to check:** Compare the column names and first row from both files

### Issue 4: All Items Show as "Edited"
**Symptoms:** Even identical items appear as edited

**Possible Causes:**
1. Hidden characters in data
2. Number format differences
3. Trailing spaces

**What to check:** Look at the normalized values in the "Change detected" messages

2. **Sample of your actual data** (just 1-2 rows):
   ```
   From old file:
   Seq.: _____
   Description: _____
   Quantity: _____
   Unit Price: _____
   Amount: _____

   From new file:
   Seq.: _____
   Description: _____
   Quantity: _____
   Unit Price: _____
   Amount: _____
   ```
